# Sudoko_Project

In this project I plan to set up and create a working Sudoku app that has a visualization of a solving algorithim.
I plan on making this:
1. Playable, with working "note numbers"
2. Able to generate totally random playable boards
3. A visual to show how the computer goes through and solves each square
4. Possibly a difficulty scale


Plans for the future but not today:
1. Online play? Make it point based on how fast u can solve to make it competitive
2. A fully functioning app that can make printable PDF's out of unsolved boards to play by hand

To be showcased on my future website!!
